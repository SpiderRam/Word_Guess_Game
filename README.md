# Word_Guess_Game

This was the homework assignment for week three of the bootcamp.  The requirements were:

~Choose a theme for your game! 

~Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

~Display the following on the page:

~Press any key to get started!

~Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

~If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.

~Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

~Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).

~After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.


Goals for improvement:  add a sound and change the picture when the user wins or loses each round.
